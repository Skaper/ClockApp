# Post-Release Improvement Plan

### 1. iOS/iPad UI Concerns
-   Need to implement iOS Human Interface Guidelines.
-   Timer input fields require redesign for touch-friendly numeric input (picker wheels or custom numeric pad)
-   iPad landscape orientation needs wider layout utilization
-   Portrait mode on iPhone requires vertical layout optimization
-   iOS-style haptic feedback integration (already partially implemented with `Handheld.Vibrate()`)
-   Background execution limitations on iOS may affect timer/stopwatch functionality
-   DOTween animations may need optimization for 60fps on older iOS devices
-   Memory management for UIRx subscriptions in mobile environment
-   Battery optimization for background tasks

### 2. Post-Release Refactoring Priorities

#### Must Happen Changes
-   Current NTP implementation lacks comprehensive error recovery, need fallback strategies when all NTP servers fail, add proper exception handling in UI layer.
-   Audit all `CompositeDisposable` usage across ViewModels
-   Implement object pooling for lap time UI items
-   Optimize texture memory usage for animations
-   Cache ReactiveProperty string formatting result
-   Current BackgroundTaskManager is too Unity-specific, need proper platform abstraction for iOS background modes.

#### Nice to Have Changes
-   Add proper state management for application lifecycle
-   Multiple timer presets with custom names
-   Export lap times functionality
-   Implement proper dark/light mode theming
-   Add more sophisticated animations and transitions
-   Custom font scaling options

### 3. VR Application Considerations

#### Core Interaction Design
-   Configure automated CI/CD pipeline to build Unity Package Manager (.unitypackage) distributions
-   Current UI assumes mouse/touch input, need abstraction for VR controllers (Ray and Hand tracking)
-   Consider floating panels around user instead of single screen approach
-   Implement proper depth and layering for multiple timers/stopwatches
-   Replace the current timer input fields with more convenient touch input, such as a dial/wheel
-   Reduce DOTween animation complexity to maintain framerate
